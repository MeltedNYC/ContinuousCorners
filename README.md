# UIBezierPath+ContinuousCorners

A Swift extension for creating a `UIBezierPath` with smooth rounded corners that will match the iPhone X. 

`+[UIBezierPath bezierPathWithRoundedRect:cornerRadius:]`  will also give you smooth corners, but does not allow you to specify the radius for each corner individually - this does.

Based on [everdrone/react-native-super-ellipse-mask](https://github.com/everdrone/react-native-super-ellipse-mask)/[sugarmo/SGMSuperEllipsePath](https://github.com/sugarmo/SGMSuperEllipsePath) and converted to Swift.
